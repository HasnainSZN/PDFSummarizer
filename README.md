# PDFSummarizer
Project Overview:
The PDF Summarizer Web Application is designed to streamline the process of summarizing lengthy PDF documents. Built using Next.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, this tool allows users to upload PDF files, which are then processed to generate concise summaries. The integration of LLMs ensures that the summaries capture the most important points from the document, making it easier for users to extract key information quickly.

# Key Features:
PDF Upload: Users can upload PDF documents directly through the web interface.

Automated Summarization: The backend processes the PDF and uses a powerful summarization model to generate a concise summary.

Instant Results: Once the file is uploaded, the user can view the summary within seconds.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

# Tech Stack:
Frontend: Next.js (React-based framework for building user interfaces)

Backend: FastAPI (High-performance web framework for handling API requests)

Machine Learning Model: LLM-based summarization model (Llama 3.1)

File Handling: PDF file parsing and processing using Python libraries

Axios: For handling HTTP requests between the frontend and backend

# How It Works:
The user uploads a PDF file through the frontend.

The uploaded file is sent to the FastAPI backend for processing.

The backend uses a summarization model to generate a brief summary of the PDF.

The generated summary is returned to the frontend and displayed to the user.

# Potential Use Cases:
Legal and Academic Research: Quickly extract key points from lengthy documents or research papers.

Business and Finance: Summarize reports, presentations, or contracts for easier review.

Education: Students can summarize textbooks or articles to save time during study sessions.
